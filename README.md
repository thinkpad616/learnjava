how does bytecode gets generated?
java compiler converts .java file to .class or bytecode

what are components of jvm and explain?
jvm consists of five main components 
1. class loader sub system.
 1. Loading: Classloader is classified into three types
  1. Bootstrap classloader.
  2. Extension classloader.
  3. Application classloader.
 2. Linking.
  1. Prepare.
  2. Verify.
  3. Initialize.
 3. Initialization.
2. Run time data area or memory area.
1. Method area.
2. heap area
3. Stack area.
4. PC register.
5. Native method.
3. Execution engine.
1. Interpreter.
Executes bytecode instructions line by line
2. Just in time compiler.(jit)

3. Garbage collector.
4. Native method area.
5. Native method interface.
1. what is a class?
- A class is a blueprint or template which holds variables and methods. A class variable or method can be accessed only using object instantiation, and memory for non-static (instance) variables is allocated only when an object is created during execution. Static variables belong to the class itself and are allocated memory when the class is loaded by the JVM. A class can also have constructors to initialize object state, and access modifiers like private, protected, and public control visibility. Methods of a class are stored in the method area and frequently used methods are compiled into native code by the JIT compiler for faster execution. Garbage collector removes memory of objects when they are no longer referenced, while static members remain until JVM shuts down.
2. what is an object?
 - Object is a instance of a class, to access any member of a class.

what is parent class in java.lang package?
The parent class of all classes in Java is the Object class, which is defined in the java.lang package.
	‚Ä¢	Object is declared as a public class, so it‚Äôs accessible to all other classes.
	‚Ä¢	Every class in Java implicitly extends Object, even if you don‚Äôt write extends Object in your code.
	‚Ä¢	This means every class automatically inherits methods from the Object class ‚Äî such as:
	‚Ä¢	toString()
	‚Ä¢	equals(Object obj)
	‚Ä¢	hashCode()
	‚Ä¢	getClass()
	‚Ä¢	clone()
	‚Ä¢	finalize()
	‚Ä¢	wait(), notify(), notifyAll()

How to call one constructor from the other constructor ?
- using this() we can call other constructor in same class and it should be the first line of constructor. we can pass values as per other constructor initialization.

overriding vs overloading ?
overriding:
- overriding happens in inheritance where method from parent class is overriden in subclass
- overriding is based on runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding)
- we use @override keyword when impimenting
- we cannot reduce accessmodifer from parent class
- child class cannot throw broader checked exception from parent class. 
overloading:
- overloading is compile time polymorphism
- overloading happens in same class we can use same methodname with differt return types and input values.
- ovverloading doesnt have any barriers with exceptions or access modifier. 

what is super keyword in java?
- super key word can be used while a subclass extends parent class to reference variables in constructor which should be first line in constructor. and we can also use super key word to call method from parent class in child class.

is a relationship vs has a relationship in java?
is a relation ship is inheritance where child class extends parent class. 
has a relationship is like using object in another class. like car object (instance of class) is created in engine class and engine uses its methods. 

Explain about instanceof operator in java?
- instanceof is used to check weather an obeject is an instance of class.class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }

Animal a = new Dog();
System.out.println(a instanceof Animal);  // true
System.out.println(a instanceof Dog);     // true
System.out.println(a instanceof Object);  // true
System.out.println(a instanceof String);  // false
Animal b = null;
System.out.println(b instanceof Animal);  // false


3. Why can a class not be defined as protected?
 - class can be either public or package private only
 - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html

Explain what access modifiers can be used for variables?
private is accessable witin the class 
public is accessable anywhere
protected is accessable witin the same package. 
default is accessable within the package

explain abstract class in java?
- abstract class in java contains abstract methods along with implimentation methods with concrete logic.
- it can be used with extends keyword as a abstract class cannot be instantiated.
- Abstract classes can define fields (variables) and constructors, allowing for shared state and initialization logic among subclasses

üí° Why do we need abstract classes when Java already has inheritance and interfaces?

Even though inheritance and interfaces look similar to what abstract classes can do, abstract classes fill the gap between them ‚Äî they sit in between full abstraction (interface) and full implementation (concrete class).

‚∏ª

üîπ 1. When you need partial implementation
	‚Ä¢	An interface only defines method signatures (before Java 8) ‚Äî no implementation.
	‚Ä¢	But sometimes, you want to define some methods (common for all subclasses) and leave others abstract.
‚Üí That‚Äôs exactly what an abstract class is for.
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start(); // subclass will define

    void stop() {          // common method for all vehicles
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}
Here, Vehicle provides partial implementation ‚Äî something that interfaces can‚Äôt fully do.

üîπ 2. When you want to share common state (variables)
	‚Ä¢	An interface cannot hold instance variables (only constants ‚Äî public static final).
	‚Ä¢	But an abstract class can hold instance variables shared by all subclasses.
abstract class Employee {
    String name;
    int id;
    abstract double calculateSalary();
}
‚Üí You can store data like name and id ‚Äî interfaces can‚Äôt.

üîπ 3. When you need constructors or initialization
	‚Ä¢	Abstract classes can have constructors ‚Äî interfaces can‚Äôt.
	‚Ä¢	That allows you to initialize common variables when subclasses are created.
abstract class Shape {
    String color;
    Shape(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}
üîπ 4. When you expect closely related classes
	‚Ä¢	If you know classes are closely related and share a base behavior, use an abstract class.
	‚Ä¢	If classes are unrelated but just share a contract, use an interface.

üß† Example:
	‚Ä¢	Car, Bike, Truck ‚Üí all are vehicles ‚Üí abstract class Vehicle
	‚Ä¢	Comparable, Serializable ‚Üí unrelated behaviors ‚Üí interfaces
üîπ 5. Multiple inheritance problem
	‚Ä¢	Java doesn‚Äôt allow multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid ambiguity).
	‚Ä¢	But you can extend one abstract class and implement multiple interfaces together
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void eat();
}

interface Pet {
    void play();
}

class Dog extends Animal implements Pet {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Dog eats"); }
    public void play() { System.out.println("Dog plays"); }
}

We use abstract classes when we want to share common code or state among related classes, but still want to leave some methods for subclasses to implement.
Interfaces just define contracts without implementation, while inheritance gives full behavior reuse.
An abstract class sits in between ‚Äî it allows partial implementation, shared variables, and even constructors.
So, when classes are closely related and share common behavior, we prefer an abstract class instead of only using interfaces.


abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();  // abstract method
    void stop() {           // concrete method
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car();  // reference of abstract class
        v.start();
        v.stop();
    }
}

why abstract class when interface exists?

what are abstract methods in java?
- abstract methods does not have any implementation. 

what is an exception in java? its hierarchy ?
At the top of all errors and exceptions is the Throwable class in java.lang package.
Throwable has two main subclasses:
java.lang.Object
   ‚Ü≥ java.lang.Throwable
         ‚Ü≥ java.lang.Exception
         ‚Ü≥ java.lang.Error
‚Ä¢	Error ‚Üí serious problems (like OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError). Not meant to be handled by code.
	‚Ä¢	Exception ‚Üí conditions that programs might want to handle.

Under Exception, we have two categories:
	1.	Checked Exceptions (Compile-time exceptions)
	2.	Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime exceptions)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Checked Exceptions (Compile-time exceptions)
	‚Ä¢	Checked exceptions are checked by the compiler during compilation.
	‚Ä¢	You must handle them using try-catch or declare using throws.
	‚Ä¢	Occur due to external conditions (like file not found, database not reachable, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Examples:
	‚Ä¢	IOException
	‚Ä¢	SQLException
	‚Ä¢	ClassNotFoundException
	‚Ä¢	FileNotFoundException
try {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
}
If you don‚Äôt handle or declare a checked exception, the program won‚Äôt compile.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime exceptions)
	‚Ä¢	Unchecked exceptions are not checked by the compiler.
	‚Ä¢	Occur during program execution due to programming mistakes.
	‚Ä¢	These exceptions extend RuntimeException.
	‚Ä¢	Examples:
	‚Ä¢	ArithmeticException
	‚Ä¢	NullPointerException
	‚Ä¢	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	‚Ä¢	NumberFormatException

int a = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException
String s = null;
System.out.println(s.length());  // NullPointerException

You don‚Äôt have to handle runtime exceptions ‚Äî it‚Äôs optional, but recommended.

5Ô∏è‚É£ try, catch, and finally

try block
	‚Ä¢	Code that might cause an exception is placed inside a try block.
	‚Ä¢	Must be followed by either catch or finally.

catch block
	‚Ä¢	Used to handle the exception thrown from the try block.
	‚Ä¢	Can have multiple catch blocks for different exception types.

try {
    int a = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
}

finally block
	‚Ä¢	Always executed whether exception occurs or not.
	‚Ä¢	Used for cleanup code like closing files, database connections, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Executes even if return statement is present inside try or catch.

try {
    int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Handled: " + e);
} finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block always executes");
}

üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ throw keyword

Definition:

throw is used inside a method to actually throw an exception object manually.

It‚Äôs like saying:

‚ÄúHey Java, I want to stop execution here and signal that something went wrong!‚Äù
throw new ExceptionType("Error message");

Important Points about throw:
	1.	We can throw only one exception at a time.
	2.	The object thrown using throw must be of type Throwable or its subclass (like Exception or Error).
	3.	When we throw a checked exception, the method must either handle it with try-catch or declare it using throws.
	4.	It is used within the method body, not in the method declaration.


üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ throws keyword

Definition:

throws is used in the method declaration to indicate that the method might throw an exception.

It tells the caller of the method:

‚ÄúI may throw this exception ‚Äî you should handle it.‚Äù

returnType methodName() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2

import java.io.*;

public class ThrowsExample {
    // Declaring that this method may throw IOException
    void readFile() throws IOException {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.txt");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThrowsExample obj = new ThrowsExample();
        try {
            obj.readFile();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Important Points about throws:
	1.	throws is used in the method signature (declaration).
	2.	It is used to declare checked exceptions only.
	3.	It allows the caller of the method to decide how to handle the exception.
	4.	You can declare multiple exceptions separated by commas.
