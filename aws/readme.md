- **VPC**: Isolation and control over your own private virtual network within AWS. You define the boundaries.
- **Subnets**: Organization and segmentation of your network into logical, manageable blocks of IP addresses.
- **Route Tables**: Directs traffic to the correct destination within the VPC or to external networks.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Allows resources (in public subnets) to connect to the public internet and vice-versa.
- **NAT Gateway**: Allows private resources to initiate outbound connections to the internet (e.g., for updates) while blocking inbound requests from the internet.
- **Security Groups**: A virtual firewall at the instance level that controls specific inbound and outbound traffic to a single server.
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)**: An optional, stateless firewall at the subnet level that allows or denies traffic entering or leaving an entire subnet.
- **VPC Peering**: Connects two VPCs (e.g., a Dev VPC and a Test VPC) using private IPs, as if they are one network, without using the public internet.
- **VPC Endpoint**: Provides private access to other AWS services (like storage (S3) or databases (DynamoDB)) without needing an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Securely connects your physical on-premises network to your AWS VPC over the public internet.
- **Direct Connect**: Provides a private, high-speed, low-latency connection that completely bypasses the public internet for consistent performance and enhanced security.
- **Transit Gateway**: Simplifies network management by acting as a central router to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, preventing complex "spaghetti" of individual connections (peering or VPNs).
